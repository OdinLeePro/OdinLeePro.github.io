# About Me

I’m Odin Lee, a data scientist from **St. Paul, Minnesota**, with a strong academic background and a passion for turning data into insight.

I'm currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** at the **University of St. Thomas**, building on my **Bachelor’s degree in Data Science** from **Augsburg University**. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience in data analytics, statistical modeling, and programming.

Skilled in **Python**, **SQL**, **R**, **Java**, and **Tableau**, I enjoy transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that drive meaningful outcomes.
